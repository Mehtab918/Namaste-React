# Namaste React 

A bundler in react.js is a tool which allows to package code into a single file or bundle. Due to this size of code will reduce and so performance of application will improve. Common bundlers used with React are Webpack and Parcel.

In package.json, the tilde (~) and caret (^) symbols are used to specify the version range for dependencies, controlling how updates are handled when we run npm install.

What is the meaning of caret and tilde in package json?
Tilde allows only the patch version upgrades avoiding the minor updates while caret allows updates to patch as well as minor versions.



we can bring React into our project by using two ways:

a) using npm install react - is used to install react.  --> Recomended
b) using CDN links: <!-- <script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.development.js"></script>
        <script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>  -->

b option is not a good way to bring react to our project.
