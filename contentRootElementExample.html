<!--
In this react program i have not used selectors as ID . i used class . it is querSelector.

I want to print a paragraph in the browser . 

i took a const paragraph , creating an element p and passed the message i want to display in the paragraph.,

i created a root variable , created a root from ReactDOM libraries and passed a query selector so that React may know where this paragraph has to inserted .Root of the element.

make the render of the root .
